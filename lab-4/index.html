    <p><em>Enter a Master and a Boatswain</em></p>
    <p><strong>Master</strong><br>Boatswain!</p>
    <p><strong>Boatswain</strong><br>Here, master: what cheer?</p>
    <p><strong>Master</strong><br>
        Good, speak to the mariners: fall to't, yarely,<br> or we run ourselves aground: bestir, bestir.</p>
        <p><em>Exit</em></p>
            <p><em>Enter Mariners</em></p>
            <p><strong>Boatswain</strong><br>
                Heigh, my hearts! cheerly, cheerly, my hearts!<br>
                yare, yare! Take in the topsail. Tend to the master's whistle.<br>
                Blow, till thou burst thy wind, if room enough!</p>
            <p><em>Enter ALONSO, SEBASTIAN, ANTONIO, FERDINAND, GONZALO, andothers</em></p>
            <p><strong>ALONSO</strong><br>Good boatswain, have care. Where's the master?<br>
                Play the men.</p>
            <p><strong>Boatswain</strong><br>
                I pray now, keep below.</p>
            <p><strong>ANTONIO</strong><br>
                Where is the master, boatswain?</p>
            <p><strong>Boatswain</strong><br>
                Do you not hear him? You mar our labour:<br>
                keep your cabins: you do assist the storm.</p>
            <p><strong>GONZALO</strong><br>
                Nay, good, be patient.</p>
            <p><strong>Boatswain</strong><br>
                When the sea is. Hence!<br>
                What cares these roarers for the name of king?<br>
                To cabin: silence! trouble us not.</p>
            <p><strong>GONZALO</strong><br>
                Good, yet remember whom thou hast aboard.</p>
            <p><strong>Boatswain</strong><br>
                None that I more love than myself.<br>
                You are a counsellor; if you can command these elements to silence,<br>
                and work the peace of the present, we will not hand a rope more;<br>
                use your authority: if you cannot, give thanks you have lived so
                long,<br>
                and make yourself ready in your cabin for the mischance of the hour,<br>
                if it so hap. Cheerly, good hearts!<br>
                Out of our way, I say.</p>
            <p><em>Exit</em></p>
            <p><strong>GONZALO</strong><br>
                I have great comfort from this fellow:<br>
                methinks he hath no drowning mark upon him;<br>
                his complexion is perfect gallows.<br>
                Stand fast, good Fate, to his hanging:<br>
                make the rope of his destiny our cable,<br>
                for our own doth little advantage.<br>
                If he be not born to be hanged, our case is miserable.</p>
            <p><em>Exeunt</em></p>
            <p><em>Re-enter Boatswain</em></p>
            <p><strong>Boatswain</strong><br>
                Down with the topmast! yare! lower, lower!<br>
                Bring her to try with main-course.</p>
            <p><em>A cry within</em></p>
            <p><strong>Boatswain</strong><br>
                A plague upon this howling!<br>
                they are louder than the weather or our office.</p>
            <p><em>Re-enter SEBASTIAN, ANTONIO, and GONZALO</em></p>
            <p><strong>Boatswain</strong><br>
                Yet again! what do you here?<br>
                Shall we give o'er and drown?<br>
                Have you a mind to sink?</p>
            <p><strong>SEBASTIAN</strong><br>
                A pox o' your throat, you bawling, blasphemous,<br>
                incharitable dog!</p>
            <p><strong>Boatswain</strong><br>
                Work you then.</p>
            <p><strong>ANTONIO</strong><br>
                Hang, cur! hang, you whoreson, insolent noisemaker!<br>
                We are less afraid to be drowned than thou art.</p>
            <p><strong>GONZALO</strong><br>
                I'll warrant him for drowning; though the ship were<br>
                no stronger than a nutshell and as leaky as an unstanched wench.</p>
            <p><strong>Boatswain</strong><br>
                Lay her a-hold, a-hold!<br>
                set her two courses off to sea again; lay her off.</p>
            <p><em>Enter Mariners wet</em></p>
            <p><strong>Mariners</strong><br>
                All lost! to prayers, to prayers! all lost!</p>
            <p><strong>Boatswain</strong><br>
                What, must our mouths be cold?</p>
            <p><strong>GONZALO</strong><br>
                The king and prince at prayers! let's assist them,<br>
                For our case is as theirs.</p>
            <p><strong>SEBASTIAN</strong><br>
                I'm out of patience.</p>
            <p><strong>ANTONIO</strong><br>
                We are merely cheated of our lives by drunkards:<br>
                This wide-chapp'd rascal--would thou mightst lie drowning<br>
                The washing of ten tides!</p>
            <p><strong>GONZALO</strong><br>
                He'll be hang'd yet,<br>
                Though every drop of water swear against it<br>
                And gape at widest to glut him.</p>
            <p><em>A confused noise within: 'Mercy on us!'-- 'We split, we split!'--
                'Farewell, my wife and children!'-- 'Farewell, brother!'--'We split, we
                split, we split!'</em></p>
            <p><strong>ANTONIO</strong><br>
                Let's all sink with the king.</p>
            <p><strong>SEBASTIAN</strong><br>
                Let's take leave of him.</p>
            <p><em>Exeunt ANTONIO and SEBASTIAN</em></p>
            <p><strong>GONZALO</strong><br>
                Now would I give a thousand furlongs of sea<br>
                for an acre of barren ground, long heath, brown furze, any thing.<br>
                The wills above be done!<br>
                but I would fain die a dry death.</p>

            <a href="https://shakespeare.mit.edu/tempest/tempest.1.1.html">The
                Tempest - Scene 1</a>
            <p><em>Exeunt</em></p>
        <header><h3>Addendum</h3></header>
        <p>Again, as for the design of this webpage, I wanted it to be simple, easy on the eyes and focused on text, but at the same time somewhat connected to the play’s atmosphere.

            As for the font, I chose Georgia – serif, because it seems more traditional, appropriate for Shakespeare’s books. Thus, serif fonts also are comfortable when it comes to reading large texts. It also helps to make the title larger (h1 size is 40px) and the scene information not too intrusive, but clearly seen (h2 size is 25px). Paragraphs are being made to a readable size.
            <br>
            <br>
            The background field color is a rgb(198, 166, 166) which is damped down trying to depict the stormy setting of the scene. Of all the colors, the text color of #333 is pretty great for readability because it stands out. For the header and footer I made the color a deep, reddish-brown #8a3405 for some contrast with the grey color back ground and to symbolized the intensity of the storm. These sections are readable in white fonts for visibility.
            <br>
            <br>
            There is so much content on this page so I wanted to make sure it wasn’t cramped so I included 20px of padding for the body. nominate the space around the header and the footer (40px) thus creating a balance for the sections making this page emphasize on the key parts.
            <br>
            Such decisions allow achieving consistent design and emphasizing the script but at the same time offering engagement with the material and easy reading.</p>
        <footer>
            <p style="color: white;">Last updated: 
                <span id="lastModified"></span>

        </footer>

    <script type="text/javascript" style="display: none;">
        var x = document.lastModified;
        document.getElementById('lastModified').textContent = x;
