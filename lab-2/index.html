    <h1>The Tempest</h1>
    <h2>SCENE I. On a ship at sea: a tempestuous noise of thunder and lightning heard.</h2>

    <p><em>Enter a Master and a Boatswain</em></p>

    <p><strong>Master</strong><br>
    Boatswain!</p>

    <p><strong>Boatswain</strong><br>
    Here, master: what cheer?</p>

    <p><strong>Master</strong><br>
    Good, speak to the mariners: fall to't, yarely,<br>
    or we run ourselves aground: bestir, bestir.</p>

    <p><em>Exit</em></p>

    <p><em>Enter Mariners</em></p>

    <p><strong>Boatswain</strong><br>
    Heigh, my hearts! cheerly, cheerly, my hearts!<br>
    yare, yare! Take in the topsail. Tend to the master's whistle.<br>
    Blow, till thou burst thy wind, if room enough!</p>

    <p><em>Enter ALONSO, SEBASTIAN, ANTONIO, FERDINAND, GONZALO, and others</em></p>

    <p><strong>ALONSO</strong><br>
    Good boatswain, have care. Where's the master?<br>
    Play the men.</p>

    <p><strong>Boatswain</strong><br>
    I pray now, keep below.</p>

    <p><strong>ANTONIO</strong><br>
    Where is the master, boatswain?</p>

    <p><strong>Boatswain</strong><br>
    Do you not hear him? You mar our labour:<br>
    keep your cabins: you do assist the storm.</p>

    <p><strong>GONZALO</strong><br>
    Nay, good, be patient.</p>

    <p><strong>Boatswain</strong><br>
    When the sea is. Hence!<br>
    What cares these roarers for the name of king?<br>
    To cabin: silence! trouble us not.</p>

    <p><strong>GONZALO</strong><br>
    Good, yet remember whom thou hast aboard.</p>

    <p><strong>Boatswain</strong><br>
    None that I more love than myself.<br>
    You are a counsellor; if you can command these elements to silence,<br>
    and work the peace of the present, we will not hand a rope more;<br>
    use your authority: if you cannot, give thanks you have lived so long,<br>
    and make yourself ready in your cabin for the mischance of the hour,<br>
    if it so hap. Cheerly, good hearts!<br>
    Out of our way, I say.</p>

    <p><em>Exit</em></p>

    <p><strong>GONZALO</strong><br>
    I have great comfort from this fellow:<br>
    methinks he hath no drowning mark upon him;<br>
    his complexion is perfect gallows.<br>
    Stand fast, good Fate, to his hanging:<br>
    make the rope of his destiny our cable,<br>
    for our own doth little advantage.<br>
    If he be not born to be hanged, our case is miserable.</p>

    <p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

    <p><em>Re-enter Boatswain</em></p>

    <p><strong>Boatswain</strong><br>
    Down with the topmast! yare! lower, lower!<br>
    Bring her to try with main-course.</p>

    <p><em>A cry within</em></p>

    <p><strong>Boatswain</strong><br>
    A plague upon this howling!<br>
    they are louder than the weather or our office.</p>

    <p><em>Re-enter SEBASTIAN, ANTONIO, and GONZALO</em></p>

    <p><strong>Boatswain</strong><br>
    Yet again! what do you here?<br>
    Shall we give o'er and drown?<br>
    Have you a mind to sink?</p>

    <p><strong>SEBASTIAN</strong><br>
    A pox o' your throat, you bawling, blasphemous,<br>
    incharitable dog!</p>

    <p><strong>Boatswain</strong><br>
    Work you then.</p>

    <p><strong>ANTONIO</strong><br>
    Hang, cur! hang, you whoreson, insolent noisemaker!<br>
    We are less afraid to be drowned than thou art.</p>

    <p><strong>GONZALO</strong><br>
    I'll warrant him for drowning; though the ship were<br>
    no stronger than a nutshell and as leaky as an unstanched wench.</p>

    <p><strong>Boatswain</strong><br>
    Lay her a-hold, a-hold!<br>
    set her two courses off to sea again; lay her off.</p>

    <p><em>Enter Mariners wet</em></p>

    <p><strong>Mariners</strong><br>
    All lost! to prayers, to prayers! all lost!</p>

    <p><strong>Boatswain</strong><br>
    What, must our mouths be cold?</p>

    <p><strong>GONZALO</strong><br>
    The king and prince at prayers! let's assist them,<br>
    For our case is as theirs.</p>

    <p><strong>SEBASTIAN</strong><br>
    I'm out of patience.</p>

    <p><strong>ANTONIO</strong><br>
    We are merely cheated of our lives by drunkards:<br>
    This wide-chapp'd rascal--would thou mightst lie drowning<br>
    The washing of ten tides!</p>

    <p><strong>GONZALO</strong><br>
    He'll be hang'd yet,<br>
    Though every drop of water swear against it<br>
    And gape at widest to glut him.</p>

    <p><em>A confused noise within: 'Mercy on us!'-- 'We split, we split!'--'Farewell, my wife and children!'-- 'Farewell, brother!'--'We split, we split, we split!'</em></p>

    <p><strong>ANTONIO</strong><br>
    Let's all sink with the king.</p>

    <p><strong>SEBASTIAN</strong><br>
    Let's take leave of him.</p>

    <p><em>Exeunt ANTONIO and SEBASTIAN</em></p>

    <p><strong>GONZALO</strong><br>
    Now would I give a thousand furlongs of sea<br>
    for an acre of barren ground, long heath, brown furze, any thing.<br>
    The wills above be done!<br>
    but I would fain die a dry death.</p>

    <h1>Addendum</h1>
    <p>I use the html tag because it is the main part of any web page. Inside that, I put the head tag, which is for stuff like the title of the web page, so I put the title of the play inside the title tag. The body tag is where all the content goes. I use h1 for the main title to make it big, then I use h2 for the scene details so it's smaller but still important. I use p for every time a character talks because it helps separate what everyone says. I use br to make the lines inside speeches go to the next line without making a new paragraph. When characters like "Enter" or "Exit" happen, I put those in em tags to make them slanty (italic) so they look different from what people say. At the end, I put a footer to show when the page was last changed, and the {script} tag is there to help show that date automatically. Overall, I just use these tags to make the page look like the play and easy to read.</p>

    <footer>
        <p>Last updated: <span id="lastModified"></span></p>
    </footer>
    <script type="text/javascript">
        var x = document.lastModified;
        document.getElementById('lastModified').textContent = x;
    </script>
</body>
</html>
